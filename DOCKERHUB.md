The interface for [`orknux/orknux-server`](https://hub.docker.com/r/orknux/orknux-server):
the workflow editor, the run history, the workspace's agents, models, tools and
skills, its issue tracker, chat, and the administration screens. The manual is
part of the bundle and is served at `/docs`, so an installation with no way out
to the internet still has it.

Static files served by nginx, with the API forwarded to the server — so the
browser stays on one origin and the session cookie is first-party.

- **Source:** https://github.com/michjak-szymanski/orknux-ui
- **Licence:** AGPL-3.0-or-later
- **Exposes:** `8080`
- **Runs as:** uid `101`, not root
- **Tags:** `latest` follows `main`; `X.Y.Z` and `X.Y` come from release tags;
  `sha-<commit>` never moves.

## Running it

```yaml
services:
  orknux-ui:
    image: orknux/orknux-ui:latest
    ports: ["80:8080"]
    environment:
      ORKNUX_SERVER_URL: http://orknux-server:8080
    depends_on: [orknux-server]
```

## Settings

| Variable | What it does | Default | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ORKNUX_SERVER_URL` | Where `/api`, `/graphql` and `/mcp` are forwarded. The name has to resolve **when the container starts** — nginx looks it up once, so a server that is not up yet stops this container from starting. That is deliberate: an interface that starts without a back end serves a sign-in screen that cannot sign anybody in. | `http://orknux-server:8080` | **Yes** unless the server is reachable at exactly that name |

That is the only setting. Everything else — who may see what, which models exist,
whether chat is on — belongs to the server and is configured there.

## What it serves

- Every route answers with `index.html`, because a single page's URLs are not
  files. A deep link like `/workspace/1/executions` works on a refresh.
- `/assets/*` is content-hashed by the build and cached for a year; `index.html`
  never is, or a deployment would go on serving the previous bundle.
- `/api`, `/graphql` and `/mcp` are forwarded to `ORKNUX_SERVER_URL` with the
  caller's address preserved, so the server logs who did what.
- Answers stream unbuffered, which is what makes a chat appear as it is written
  rather than in one piece at the end.

## Behind a proxy

Terminate TLS in front of it and forward everything to `8080`. The container sets
`X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Forwarded-Proto` on what it passes to the server; if you
put another proxy in front, make sure it does too, or the audit log attributes
every action to the proxy.

## Health

`HEALTHCHECK` fetches `/` inside the container. A healthy container means the
files are being served — it says nothing about whether the server behind it is
answering, which is the Monitoring page's job.
