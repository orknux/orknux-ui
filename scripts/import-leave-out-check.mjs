/**
 * Taking components out of an import, on the rows where that means something.
 *
 * The report was a screenshot of the import dialog for a workflow file, with a
 * WORKFLOW listed as Renamed and an ACTION and a TRIGGER as Not here, and the
 * ask was "remove components". The two are not the same sort of row. The
 * workflow is *in* the envelope; the action and the trigger are names it points
 * at and never carried, so there is nothing there to remove — the fix for those
 * is to make them here, or to export again with more depth.
 *
 * So this drives the real dialog on the real file and checks three things:
 * that Leave out is offered on what the file carries and on nothing else, that
 * leaving out the last thing in a file says so instead of offering an import
 * that creates nothing, and that leaving out something a kept component needs
 * takes that one with it and says so before anything is written.
