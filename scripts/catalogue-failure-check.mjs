/**
 * A catalogue that could not be fetched saying so, instead of saying it is empty.
 *
 * Issue 139. Pickers all over the app were filled the same way -
 * `fetch(...).then(setX).catch(() => setX([]))` - so a fetch that failed
 * arrived as a list with nothing in it, and the panel printed its empty state:
 * *No tools in this workspace yet*, *No roles are defined yet. Add one on the
 * Roles screen*. That is an invitation to go and make what the installation
 * already has, said to somebody whose session has just expired.
 *
 * Both directions matter, so both are measured, on three screens that answer an
 * empty list with a sentence of their own:
 *
 *   - a workspace's own Settings, whose speech fields say no transcription or
 *     speech model has been added yet;
 *   - a workspace's Settings under Admin, which sends somebody to the Roles
 *     screen when there are no roles;
 *   - an agent's Settings, which draws three catalogues at once - the memory
 *     catalogs, skill catalogs and tools it may be granted.
 *
 * Each catalogue is asked for twice. Answered with an empty list, the page must
 * say the thing has none, in the words it always used. Answered with an error,
 * it must say it could not list them, say what to do about it, and must NOT say
 * there are none. The second half is what fails against the old code; the first
 * half is why it cannot be passed by deleting the empty state.
 *
 * The failure is forced at the network rather than by stopping the server, so
 * the status is chosen and the wording that turns on it can be read: 500 says
 * try again, 401 says sign in again. Only the catalogue queries of the screen
 * being read are touched, so the screen itself still loads - a page that did
 * not render is a page this cannot measure.
