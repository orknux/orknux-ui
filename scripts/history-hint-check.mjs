/**
 * The History and Publications panels: explanation behind the (?), status still
 * in the open.
 *
 * `UI-DESIGN-RULES.md` states the convention and, in the same section, the
 * exceptions to it. This panel had one of each, two lines apart, which is why
 * it is worth a check of its own rather than a line in `hint-forms-check`:
 *
 *   - "Every save keeps what this was before it. How long they are kept is an
 *     administrator's setting." explains what the panel is. It goes behind the
 *     question mark.
 *   - "Nothing yet. The next save will keep what this says now, and it will
 *     appear here." is the state of the thing being looked at. The rules list
 *     that among what stays visible, and it is quoted there almost word for
 *     word.
 *
 * A check that only asserted "no prose in the panel" would pass a panel that
 * had lost both, and losing the second is a real regression: it is the only
 * thing a component with no history says. So both halves are here, and the
 * failure of either is named.
 *
 * `RevisionHistory` is one component standing in four frames - the tool
 * editor's aside, the function editor's, the skill editor's, and a card on the
 * agent settings page. Two of those are driven, chosen because their layouts
 * differ most (an aside beside a code editor, a card in a column of cards), and
 * the source half below asserts that the other two are the same component
 * rather than copies that could be converted separately and were not.
 *
 * The Publications panel on a workflow's settings page is the same shape and is
 * checked the same way, because it is the same split with the halves further
 * apart: what a publication *is* is told once, and whether this workflow has
 * one is told every time. Its note has a second requirement of its own - "the
 * newest publication is what triggers and schedules run" is the fact somebody
 * needs before restoring an older one, so the check asks for that sentence by
 * name rather than for the note being non-empty. A note trimmed for brevity on
 * the way behind the (?) is the failure worth catching here.
 *
 * Builds its own tool, agent and workflow and takes them away again, named
 * after the clock so a failed run leaves nothing another run trips over - and
 * because a workflow *definition* cannot be removed at all, only unassigned, so
 * the name it was given is taken for good.
