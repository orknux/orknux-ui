/**
 * Opening an agent node's definition without losing the graph.
 *
 * Issue #149: "agent definition in Workflow editor does not open in left menu -
 * instead it redirects to another page". A trigger node and an action node put
 * the definition they point at in the panel down the left and keep the canvas
 * on the screen; the agent node navigated to the agent's settings page, which
 * takes the graph away to answer a question about it.
 *
 * So this presses Open definition on both kinds, in the same editor, in the same
 * run: the trigger is the behaviour that was already right and is here as the
 * comparison, the agent is the one that was wrong. Both are measured the same
 * way - a panel that opens holding that definition, and an editor that is still
 * underneath it.
