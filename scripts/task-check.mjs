/**
 * Tasks: starting one from the page, and its event log filling up.
 *
 * Issue #229. What a task is, is an agent given a problem and left to work at
 * it, so what this walks is the path a person walks: open Tasks, say what you
 * want, choose who is to do it, press Start, and land on the page that shows
 * what it is doing.
 *
 * **It needs no model that answers, and that is deliberate.** The prompt is
 * written into the task's log before the model is asked, and a model that never
 * answers is recorded as a note saying so - so the log holds lines either way,
 * and every assertion here is about the machinery around the model rather than
 * about anything a model said. That is what lets this run unattended, where the
 * two checks about stopping for permission cannot. The model it makes is pointed
 * at `.invalid`, which by definition cannot resolve, so nothing here touches a
 * network.
 *
 * It builds its own model and cleans up after itself: the seeded fixture has no
 * model on a database built from nothing, and a check that borrows whatever
 * happens to be there says a different thing on every installation. Since issue
 * #295 it builds an agent on that model as well, because a task is given to an
 * agent and there is no longer a bare model in the picker to give it to.
