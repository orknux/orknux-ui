/**
 * How long finished runs are kept, on the screen that decides it.
 *
 * Nothing deleted a run before 0.9.7 - no retention, no sweep, and no cascade,
 * because `workflow_execution` carries no foreign key on the workspace or the
 * workflow - so the table grew without bound and a workspace's list counted
 * runs of workflows it no longer had. Issue #167.
 *
 * The same four things `revision-retention-check` asks of the setting beside
 * this one, because they are the same bargain: the field shows what is stored,
 * Save is dead until the number differs, a reload still shows it, and zero is
 * refused - a retention of none is a feature switched off by a number, and the
 * switch for that would be a different setting.
 *
 * What it does not assert is the sweep itself. That is `ExecutionRetentionTest`
 * on the server, where a clock can be moved; this is the screen.
