/**
 * The sentence under every paginated list, and whether it names what is above it.
 *
 * The report: the workflow list's footer read "Showing 1-25 of 27 templates".
 * The rows above it are workflows. A template is a different thing in this
 * product - a published copy of a component, kept on the Templates page under
 * Admin and reached from the workflow list's own Use Template button - so the
 * footer was not using a loose word for a workflow, it was naming another
 * screen's noun. The size control beside it inherits the same word and asked
 * "How many templates to show at once" about rows that are not templates.
 *
 * One call site had it wrong out of fourteen, which is the reason this check
 * exists rather than a one-line fix: `CompactPagination` takes the noun as a
 * prop, so the component cannot be right or wrong on its own and every call
 * site is a fresh chance to get it wrong. Nothing else compared the word in the
 * footer against the list it sits under, and nothing would have noticed the
 * fourteenth.
 *
 * So the check has two halves that need each other:
 *
 *   - the source half reads every `<CompactPagination>` out of `src/` and
 *     fails on any whose `unit` is not in the table below. A new paginated
 *     list is then a check failure until somebody writes down what its rows
 *     are called, which is the only way "wherever it is shared" stays true
 *     after today;
 *   - the browser half opens each list that has a route of its own and reads
 *     the sentence the page actually drew - the noun, and that the total is a
 *     fact about the list rather than about the page. A footer counting the
 *     rows in front of it is the other half of the original report, and it is
 *     caught here by turning the page: the range moves, the total does not.
 *
 * The nouns are mostly the heading lowercased, and the table says so by holding
 * the heading too. Three deliberately differ - Executions lists runs, the audit
 * log lists entries, a session lists lines - and those are written down with
 * why, because an unexplained mismatch is exactly what this is looking for.
 *
 * The size control is part of the footer's contract now, not a nicety some
 * lists have: "not all table views contain a show X per page option" was a
 * user's report, and the fix was to offer it beside every count. So the source
 * half fails on any `<CompactPagination>` without `pageSizes`, and the browser
 * half fails on any footer drawn without the select beside it.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * And the row above the list, as of issue #174
 *
 * The same wrong noun came back at the other end of the same table: the first
 * column of the workflow list was headed "Template name". The footer half above
 * could not have caught it - it reads `<CompactPagination>` call sites, and a
 * column heading is not one.
 *
 * Only half of what is done for footers can honestly be done for headings. The
 * source half cannot: a footer's noun is a prop on one shared component, so it
 * can be read out of any file and compared against a table, while a heading row
 * is hand-written JSX in twenty-four pages with no shared component, no prop,
 * and nothing to compare a parse against. What *can* be done is the browser
 * half, and it costs nothing extra: this check already opens every routed list
 * and already knows what each one's rows are called, so it reads the heading
 * row off the same page it reads the footer off.
 *
 * Two assertions, and the difference between them matters. The first is the
 * spelled-out one, the same as `unit === 'templates'` above: "template" is
 * another page's noun and may not head a column on any of these lists. The
 * second is the discipline that keeps it true after today - each list's first
 * column heading is written down in the table below, so renaming one is a
 * failure until somebody says what it is now. That is deliberately not "the
 * heading must be the list's noun": the audit log's first column is Action and
 * its rows are entries, and both are right.
