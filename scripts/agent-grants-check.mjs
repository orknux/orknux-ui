/**
 * An agent's grants: bounded, searchable, and explained behind a (?).
 *
 * Two issues over the same twenty rows of markup, measured in one run.
 *
 * **#172** - the grant lists drew every row at full height with no bound, so a
 * workspace with a few dozen tools was a wall of checkboxes that pushed the
 * switches under it, the MCP servers and Save off the screen, and the only way
 * to find a tool was to scroll and read it. Each group has a scroll box now, a
 * search that narrows as you type, and a count. The rule that needed deciding
 * is what a search does to a row that is already granted, and the answer is
 * nothing: a ticked row is drawn whatever is typed, in the place it already
 * occupied, and marked so it is clear it is not a match. A search that can hide
 * a grant is how the same tool gets granted twice and how one fails to be
 * revoked.
 *
 * **#173** - Orknux and Shells printed their explanation as a paragraph while
 * MCP Servers had a (?), which is the one arrangement UI-DESIGN-RULES.md calls
 * worse than either convention applied whole. Both moved behind a (?), and the
 * (?) is beside the row being granted rather than the heading above it.
 *
 * Both halves are measured **in both frames**, which is the part that could not
 * be taken on trust: since #149 the agent's settings page and the workflow
 * editor's left panel render one `AgentForm`, and the panel is the narrower of
 * the two - a cap that leaves the page readable can still leave the panel a
 * wall of its own.
 *
 * It writes nothing it does not remove. Where the workspace has too few tools
 * to prove a bound with, it makes its own under a name nobody would mistake for
 * real, deletes them at the end, and sweeps any an earlier killed run left
 * behind. The agent it drives is never saved: what it ticks lives in the form
 * until the page is left, and it leaves without pressing Save.
