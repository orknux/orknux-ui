/**
 * The Sessions list and one session's transcript - issue #158.
 *
 * #119 built both pages and nothing in `suite.mjs` opened either of them.
 * `screenshots.mjs` photographs them for the manual, which is why they looked
 * covered: a picture says a page rendered on somebody's machine once, not that
 * the search still searches. Every control on these two screens is of the kind
 * that breaks quietly - a filter that has stopped filtering still draws a list,
 * and a sort that has stopped sorting still draws it in some order.
 *
 * So what is measured is narrowing and reordering rather than presence:
 *
 *   the list, searched      - the rows go down, they are the right rows, and
 *                             clearing the box brings the others back. A search
 *                             matching nothing says so rather than showing all
 *   the four-way kind chip  - each of User / Agent / Tool / System leaves only
 *                             lines of that kind, and the kinds this transcript
 *                             has none of leave none
 *   the transcript searched - matched against who spoke as well as what was said
 *   Time and Kind           - the drawn order changes, and each order is the one
 *                             the server was asked for rather than merely
 *                             different
 *   two presses to remove   - see below
 *
 * The delete is the assertion this check exists for, so it is not read off the
 * screen. A page that navigated away, drew an empty list and left the row in the
 * database would satisfy anything read from the browser. Between the first press
 * and the second the *server* is asked whether the session is still there, over
 * the check's own login rather than the page's - which is also why the question
 * cannot be asked by clicking anything: the button disarms on blur, so touching
 * the page between the two presses is the one thing that would turn the second
 * press into a first press and make this drill a pantomime.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why the fixture is a workflow run
 *
 * There is no mutation that makes a session and there should not be: a session
 * exists because an agent node carrying a `sessionKey` ran, and the page says so
 * in its own empty state. So this builds one the only way there is - a scratch
 * workflow of a session node wired to an agent, run twice under one key and once
 * under another - and removes the sessions and the workflow afterwards.
 *
 * It does not need a model that answers. The question is written into the
 * session before the model is asked, and an answer that never comes is recorded
 * as a system note, so the transcript holds two kinds either way: USER and AGENT
 * where a model answered, USER and SYSTEM where none could be reached. Nothing
 * below is written against which of the two it got - the kinds are read back off
 * the server and every assertion is made against what is actually there, which
 * is what lets one check say the same thing on a developer's machine and in CI.
 *
 * What it cannot sweep is the three executions the runs leave. There is no
 * mutation that removes one and `removeWorkflow` leaves them behind, so they
 * stay: runs of a workflow that no longer exists, on no list of it.
