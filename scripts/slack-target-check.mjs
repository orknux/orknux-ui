/**
 * What a Slack connection can see, said beside the field as it is typed.
 *
 * Issue #176's checking half. `slackTarget` answers a question about a user or
 * a channel with one of three outcomes and a sentence ready to show, and this
 * drives the two interfaces that show it: the action form, where a send is
 * defined, and the workflow editor's node panel, where one step of a workflow
 * binds its own target. The second is where the report came from - the form had
 * been given the answer and the panel had not - and both are driven here rather
 * than in two files, because the whole reason the box is one component is that
 * the two must not drift, and a shared piece of code only one check reads
 * proves nothing about the other.
 *
 * The three outcomes are not three shades of the same thing, and every claim
 * here is about keeping them apart:
 *
 *   1. The sentence arrives unaltered. Every outcome is asserted as an exact
 *      string against what came back on the wire, because the server's wording
 *      is the feature - it says which connection was asked, what it could not
 *      see, and, when the question could not be put at all, which scope to add
 *      and why sending never needed it. An interface that trimmed it to a line
 *      would be throwing away the half that says what to do.
 *   2. `NOT_FOUND` is advice and not a refusal. It is not painted the colour a
 *      refused save is painted - measured, per channel, against an element
 *      painted `--color-danger` on the same page - and, the assertion that
 *      matters most, Save stays live and the action saves as typed. The server
 *      has a test pinning exactly that; this is the same claim from the other
 *      side of the wire.
 *   3. `UNCHECKED` is not a judgement on the typing either. It keeps the
 *      ordinary hint grey, and its long sentence is printed whole.
 *   4. The answer never lags the field. A reply to text that has since been
 *      edited must not be drawn, and neither must the previous answer sit under
 *      new text while the new one is in flight - both are the same lie as a
 *      description a keystroke behind, and the second is the one a `current`
 *      flag alone does not stop.
 *   5. It does not move the form. Measured as the top of the Create Action
 *      button, across the shortest and longest answers there are - a hint that
 *      grows and shrinks under the pointer is what makes a live one feel broken.
 *   6. It is not a request per keystroke, and it is not asked at all about a
 *      connection that is not Slack or a field with nothing in it.
 *   7. The panel asks about the one parameter that is a Slack target, and only
 *      when it is one. Not `threadTs`, which is a timestamp sitting two boxes
 *      away under the same connection; not a target on the Reference tab, whose
 *      value arrives at run time from elsewhere in the graph, so there is
 *      nothing to check before the run and the name being read is not a channel
 *      name; and not a target on a node whose action sends through a mail
 *      server, because a node binds where a message goes but never which
 *      connection it goes through. Each of those is silence rather than an
 *      empty box, and none of them is a question put to the server.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * And the suggesting half, which is the rest of #176
 *
 * `slackSuggestions` is the same two endpoints read the other way round: what
 * the connection can see that matches what has been typed so far. It is offered
 * under the field, on both surfaces, by the same component - and the claims
 * about it are the claims about the check with one more running through all of
 * them, which is that a picker here may never become a gate:
 *
 *   8. It fills the field and it never fences it. Something in no list is typed,
 *      kept and saved; a name taken off the list is put in the field and nothing
 *      else happens to it. The list is dismissed with Escape and what was typed
 *      survives being dismissed.
 *   9. A partial list says so. `complete: false` arrives with the server's line
 *      about it and that line is on screen, verbatim, at the head of the list it
 *      is about - because a list that quietly leaves things out teaches somebody
 *      it is the whole of what exists, and the first channel it does not hold
 *      costs them the thing the picker was for.
 *  10. `UNCHECKED` draws the reason and no list. Not an empty list, which reads
 *      as "there is nothing there" - the one thing an unchecked answer is not -
 *      and not a list at all where there is neither a row nor a reason.
 *  11. The two answers about one field are not two paragraphs under it. What is
 *      known about the typing stays in the answer box; what is known about the
 *      list is drawn inside the list; and a name taken from the list silences
 *      the check, which is asked nothing about it at all.
 *  12. It can be driven from the keyboard - down, up, Enter to take, Escape to
 *      give up - and the arrows are the same cursor the pointer moves. The list
 *      opens on no row on purpose: this field stands in a form where Enter
 *      saves, so Enter takes a row only once the arrows have put it on one.
 *      And, as with the answer: debounced, never stale, and it moves nothing.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * And never being told which kind it is, which is the rest of #176
 *
 * The report was that the check "does not work on users", and the cause was not
 * the member lookup. The panel worked the kind out of the action's definition,
 * and where the definition had none it concluded there was nobody to ask - so a
 * connection whose bot token was missing `users:read` answered somebody with
 * silence, which is the one thing an `UNCHECKED` explicitly is not. The kind was
 * never needed to ask: it only ever chose which of Slack's two endpoints did the
 * looking up, and Slack does not differentiate when sending. So it is not stored
 * at all any more - an action holds a name, and the send resolves that name when
 * the message goes - and the Channel/User control that used to sit above the
 * field has gone with it.
 *
 *  13. Neither surface tells the server which kind it is asking about, and both
 *      are measured on the wire rather than on the screen: no `target` travels
 *      with either question, from the action form or from the panel. There is nothing
 *      left to send one from, and a narrowing put back would be a list cut to
 *      half of what the connection can offer, chosen by a form that has no way
 *      of knowing which half is right. Silence is left to the one case that
 *      deserves it, which is no Slack connection to ask.
 *  14. One list holds both kinds, so every row says which it is - carried on the
 *      row, drawn as a mark, and named for anything that is listening rather
 *      than looking. All three are asserted separately: a row that knew and did
 *      not show would pass one of them. Taking a row fills the field and does
 *      nothing else, on either surface: the action form has no Target control left to
 *      settle, which is asserted as an absence so that the dropdown coming back
 *      is a failure rather than a silent return, and the panel leaves the
 *      definition exactly as it found it, which is read back over the wire. The
 *      answer under the field says which kind a typed name turned out to be, in
 *      the same mark the rows draw, on both surfaces - the question never naming
 *      one, there is nowhere else that could be learned from. And a connection
 *      that can read one of the two halves offers everything from the half it
 *      can read, says in one line which half is missing, and leaves the name
 *      `UNCHECKED` rather than ruling on it.
 *
 * The first leg runs against the real server with no interception at all, and
 * puts both questions to it: a Slack connection with no bot token stored, which
 * is answered `UNCHECKED` in one sentence without anything having to reach
 * slack.com. That is the leg that
 * proves the query, the variables and the schema agree with the server the
 * suite is running against. The three outcomes are then forced by answering the
 * query in the browser, because `FOUND` needs a Slack workspace to be found in
 * and `NOT_FOUND` needs one to be absent from, and neither is a thing CI has.
 *
 * It makes its own connections and its own action, and removes all three.
