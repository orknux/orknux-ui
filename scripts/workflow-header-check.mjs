/**
 * The workflow list's header row: one line, and the right nouns on it.
 *
 * Issue #174, three faults the owner found in one header while testing 0.9.0:
 *
 *   1. the sort control sat on a row of its own between the heading and the
 *      table, while Auto / Import / Use template / + Create Workflow sat on the
 *      header row above it;
 *   2. the first column was headed "Template name" over a list of workflows -
 *      the same wrong noun the footer under it carried until 788b694, and
 *      wrong for the same reason: a template is a published copy of a
 *      component, kept on another page;
 *   3. "two controls floating under the title, with no label". Those were the
 *      sort control's own select and direction button. Nothing was orphaned and
 *      nothing was missing - the row held one control and its 10px grey label,
 *      which is what a lone control on an empty line looks like.
 *
 * So 1 and 3 are one fault and one fix, and the thing worth holding the page to
 * is *measured*, not photographed: the sort control and the four buttons have
 * to share a row. Vertical centres, because "same line" is a fact about
 * geometry and a screenshot of it is a fact about somebody's eyesight. Two
 * pixels of tolerance for controls of different heights sitting on `align-items:
 * center`.
 *
 * The last assertion is the one that keeps the fix honest rather than pretty:
 * moving a control is only a fix if it still works where it landed, so the
 * direction button is pressed and the list has to come back in the other order.
