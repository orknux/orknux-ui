/**
 * A model provider's credential: its own key, or a workspace secret it reads.
 *
 * Issue #232, and the second answer to it. The choice was a pair of tabs above
 * the Authentication card, which reads as a mode of the card because that is
 * where it was; it is a property of the one field it decides. So the placement
 * is measured here as well as the behaviour: the tabs stand inside the field
 * block that holds the box, on the label's own line, directly above the one
 * control that block draws, and they are named after that field rather than
 * after the card. A card with two secrets is then two of these and no
 * ambiguity - which is the whole reason for the move, since a provider has one
 * secret column and a Slack connection has two.
 *
 * The server takes one of the two and refuses the pair, so the form
 * has to be a thing that cannot ask for both — and the whole of the risk is in
 * the field that was already there. "A key is stored, leave it alone" is
 * spelled as a `null` secret and drawn as a row of dots, and every arrangement
 * that lets somebody choose a variable instead has a way of turning that into
 * "clear the key" or into "this save changed nothing". So the credential is
 * driven here end to end and read back off the server rather than off the
 * screen:
 *
 *   - a provider made with a key of its own holds one, and reveals it;
 *   - a provider made reading a secret holds none, and names the one it reads;
 *   - an edit that does not touch the credential leaves the stored key *byte
 *     for byte*, which is the assertion this check exists for;
 *   - moving from a key to a secret drops the key, and moving back demands a
 *     new one rather than offering to leave alone a key that is not there.
 *
 * Only secrets are offerable. A value is returned with the variable listing, so
 * a provider may not read one and the server says so — but a picker that offers
 * one and lets the save explain it afterwards has taught the rule at the cost
 * of a save. The list is asserted to hold the secret and not the value.
 *
 * And the sentence a broken credential gets. A provider that cannot read its
 * key fails a connection check exactly the way an unreachable one does; issue
 * #211 is what happens when the screen then says something about the endpoint.
 * Two states are read: a secret with nothing in it, where the words are the
 * server's own and name the variable, and a reference pointing at nothing.
 *
 * That second one is put in front of the page rather than made, and
 * deliberately so. It has no route through the API — deleting a variable a
 * provider reads is refused, and so is deleting the catalog holding it, both of
 * which are asserted here — so it arrives only from a restore or a database
 * edited by hand. The state is real, the way to reach it is not, so the answer
 * comes back through the browser with the flag set, exactly as the server would
 * send it.
 *
 * It writes nothing it does not remove: its own catalog, its own variables and
 * its own providers, all under a name nobody would mistake for real, swept at
 * the end and swept again by prefix at the start in case a run was killed.
