/**
 * How long a stuck task waits, set on the Admin screen.
 *
 * Issue #297 put a net under the hand-over: something looks on a timer and
 * picks up anything that has been sitting at Queued longer than it should be.
 * The number that says how long was asked for as a setting rather than a
 * property with a follow-up, and a setting nobody can reach is a constant with
 * extra steps - so this drives the field the way a person does. It is the
 * retention check's shape, against the field beside it, plus the one thing that
 * field does not have.
 *
 * That one thing: **the control is drawn only where the inline engine is
 * running.** An installation carrying its tasks on Temporal recovers a stuck
 * one through Temporal and takes the interval from its configuration file, so
 * the field is not offered there at all.
 *
 * Which of the two this is, is asked rather than assumed. On the inline engine
 * the field is driven for real and the absent case is staged by answering
 * `taskSweepConfigurable` with false on the way to the page - which changes
 * what is drawn and nothing that is stored. On Temporal the absent case is
 * simply true, and the half that types into the field is not driven at all,
 * because the server refuses to store the number there and a forged screen
 * over a refusing server measures the forgery.
 *
 * Puts the original number back before it exits, whichever way it went.
