/**
 * Builds the workspace the manual is photographed in.
 *
 * The screenshots used to come from whatever happened to be in the developer's
 * database, which is how a manual ends up showing a workflow called `dgd` and a
 * model called `whiper`. That is not a screenshot problem — no capture script
 * can photograph content that is not there — so the content is made here, and
 * the capture points at it.
 *
 * It builds a *second* workspace and never touches the first, because for a
 * long time the database this ran against was somebody's working data and a
 * documentation script has no business editing it. That is no longer where it
 * is pointed - orknux-server's `scripts/screenshots.ps1` stands an installation
 * up for this and throws it away afterwards, and runs this inside it:
 *
 *   docker compose -f scripts/screens-compose.yaml exec ui node scripts/seed-demo.mjs
 *
 * The guard stays anyway. What it protects against is somebody pointing
 * ORKNUX_UI_URL at their own server, which is one environment variable away and
 * exactly how this nearly took a tracker with seventy-five issues in it.
 *
 * Idempotent by demolition: a workspace of this name is deleted and rebuilt, so
 * a second run leaves one clean copy rather than two half-populated ones.
 *
 * The demonstration is a company of its own - Northwind - and not the company
 * whose name a development installation is likely to have grown by accident.
 * The first version of this seed was called "Acme Support", somebody started
 * keeping real work in the workspace it built, and from then on the manual was
 * photographing a live tracker: real issue titles, real conversations, real
 * notifications. Two names cannot be argued with at a distance, so the demo
 * takes a name nothing else here would reach for, and the two workflows it
 * builds are named for what they do rather than for what the old ones were
 * called - workflow names are unique across the whole installation, not per
 * workspace, so reusing them would collide with whatever holds them now.
 */

 * Empty is the only copy there has ever been, so a plain run - including every

 * builds a second, because the browser suite cannot run several checks at once
 * while they all share a workspace, and one seeded copy per worker is what
 * makes it possible. Issue #308.
 *
 * Imported rather than spelled again here: the suite looks its fixture up by

 * an executions list whose top row was a red "Answer a question asked in Slack",
 * which reads as a product that cannot run its own example. What the shape here
 * has to match is the trigger the graph was drawn around, so this is the event
 * Slack would have delivered.
 *
 * The reply step sends nothing, and that is fine: the connection it posts
 * through holds no bot token, so the action reports that it sent nothing and
 * the run completes. A skipped step with a reason on it is a better picture
 * than a failure, because it is what an installation with one integration
 * still to configure actually looks like. It was briefly the other thing - a
 * fixture bot token was seeded, Slack answered `invalid_auth`, and a refusal
 * is a permanent failure - and the connection above says why it no longer is.
 *
 * Three of them rather than one, and each naming a different ticket, because
 * the session node in the graph keys on `trigger.ticket`: one event is one
 * conversation, so three events are the three rows the Sessions page is a

 * this machine holds. On a machine with none they photograph as an empty box,
 * which tells a reader nothing about what either page is for.
 *
 * So this adds by name, and only when the name is free. Nothing here is edited
 * or deleted. The rest of this script may demolish a workspace it built itself;
 * these two lists can hold somebody's real proxies and real machines, and a
 * documentation script has no business touching those.
 *
 * Every address below is a literal address on a private network, which is not a
 * style choice. A shell's host goes past the same guard every outbound address
 * goes past, and a name that does not resolve is refused as it is saved - so
 * `build.northwind.example`, which is what the rest of this seed would have
 * reached for, cannot be stored at all. A literal `10.` address has nothing to
 * look up, and points at a network this machine is not on.
