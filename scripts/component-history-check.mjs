/**
 * What a component has been, browsed and put back, from the screen.
 *
 * Issue #141 asked for three things and only the first two are testable from a
 * server: browse the history, see the snapshot at a given time, and restore
 * one. The third is the one that goes wrong quietly in an interface — a
 * Restore that calls the mutation and leaves the editor holding the version it
 * just replaced will put that version straight back on the next save, and
 * nothing on screen says so. So this presses the button and then reads the
 * component back off the server.
 *
 * Two halves, because the rule behind them differs. A tool has no draft, so
 * every save is a version of it. A workflow has one, so only publishing is —
 * and restoring a publication deliberately does not touch the draft, which is
 * the assertion at the end.
 *
 * Builds its own tool and its own workflow, and takes both away again - except
 * the workflow *definition*, which nothing can remove: `removeWorkflow`
 * unassigns it from the workspace and the definition is kept on purpose, so the
 * name stays taken and every run needs a new one. That is why everything here
 * is named after the clock.
