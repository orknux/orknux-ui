/**
 * Prose in the open, wherever it still is.
 *
 * The report that started this was one checkbox. The workspace settings page
 * had a (?) on the model field and a four-line paragraph under the switch
 * directly below it - the same screen, both conventions - and it was the third
 * such report in twenty minutes. The four checks already in this folder each
 * drive a screen somebody had already converted and assert that particular
 * screen stayed converted; none of them could say anything about the screen
 * nobody had looked at yet, which is where every one of those reports came
 * from. This one is written the other way round: it starts from the whole of
 * `src/` and asks what is left.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * How a paragraph under a field is recognised
 *
 * Not by a list of class names. A list of names is defeated the first time
 * somebody writes `styles.blurb`, and this codebase already spells the same
 * idea eleven ways - fieldNote, fieldHint, settingNote, checkboxHint, paramHint,
 * parameterNote, choiceNote, hint, note, emptyNote, disclaimer.
 *
 * What they have in common is not the name, it is the paint. Every one of them
 * is a rule in a CSS module that sets `color: var(--color-text-muted)` (or
 * -secondary, or -tertiary) together with a font-size below the body's. That is
 * the house style for "small grey words underneath something", and a new class
 * of this kind will be written the same way, whatever it is called, because
 * that is what makes it look like the others.
 *
 * So the first half of the signature is read out of the stylesheets: every
 * class painted muted-and-small. The second half is read out of the JSX: the
 * element's *own* text - not a child's - containing an unbroken run of at least
 * five hard-coded words. That second half is what separates a paragraph from a
 * badge, a column heading or a label: those hold one or two words, or they hold
 * `{value}` and no hard-coded words at all. An explanation is always a sentence
 * somebody typed.
 *
 * And one particular affordance by name: the ⓘ. Five pages carried their
 * explanation in a footer with an info icon beside it - an icon plus prose,
 * which is the same job the (?) does and a second convention for doing it. The
 * icon is looked for directly, because "one affordance for one job" is the
 * whole point and a check that only counted paragraphs would pass a page that
 * moved its paragraph behind a different picture.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * How something is allowed to stay
 *
 * Two tables, and the difference between them is the difference between a class
 * that never explains a field and a call site that happens not to.
 *
 * `NOT_A_FIELD_NOTE` is the first: a handful of classes whose job is to carry a
 * *page's* or a *card's* own sentence. A page subtitle sits under the heading
 * and names the page; a Danger Zone card's message is about the button beside
 * it. Neither is a field's explanation and neither ever will be, so they are
 * excused once by name rather than a hundred times by call site.
 *
 * `IN_THE_OPEN` is the second, and it is the one that matters: every remaining
 * block of prose in the interface, one line each, with a `because` from a fixed
 * vocabulary and a sentence saying why. The vocabulary is the rules file's list
 * of what still belongs in the open, and nothing else is a valid answer:
 *
 *   'status'   the state of the thing being looked at, or the result of
 *              something the reader just did
 *   'error'    an error or a warning
 *   'label'    a sentence that is part of the field's label - a unit, an
 *              option's own name
 *   'in-flight' another agent is converting this file right now; the entry
 *              names them and comes out when they land
 *
 * An entry that names none of those does not compile as an exemption, and an
 * entry whose sentence has left the interface fails as loudly as an unlisted
 * one - so the table cannot rot into a list of screens that no longer exist.
 *
 * This is deliberately not a check that can tell teaching from status by
 * itself. It cannot: "No sessions yet" and "A session is one running
 * conversation" are the same shape to a parser. What it can do - and what stops
 * the whack-a-mole - is refuse to let any of it be unaccounted for. A new
 * paragraph under a new field fails this check the moment it is written, and
 * the only ways to make it pass are to move it behind a (?) or to write down,
 * in this file, which of the four things it is.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The browser half
 *
 * The source half above is the valuable one: it runs in a second, it reads
 * every file, and a page that fails to render cannot hide anything from it. The
 * browser half is there for the thing source cannot see - what a real page
 * actually draws under a real control - and it walks the routes out of
 * `src/navigation.ts` rather than a list written here, because a list written
 * here is a list that stops covering the page somebody adds tomorrow.
 *
 * It is structural rather than class-based, because a production build hashes
 * the class names away: for every input, select and textarea on the page it
 * finds the field that control stands in and reads whatever text the field
 * prints *after* the control. Five words or more of that is a paragraph under a
 * field, and it has to be in the same table.
 *
 * ORKNUX_SOURCE_ONLY=1 runs the source half alone, which is what a pre-commit
 * hook or a machine with no server on 5173 wants.

/**

 *
 * Excused once by name because the shape is structural: each of these sits

 * and is not on this list.

/**

 *
 * The export dialog was reported with four lines of prose under its title. It
 * had not been missed - it was excused, by `dialogMessage` being on this list
 * as "the line under a dialog title". The class was right about what it is for
 * and said nothing about how much of it there may be, so a paragraph wearing it
 * inherited a subtitle's exemption.
 *
 * A line is excused because it names the thing, and naming takes a sentence or
 * two. Past that it is teaching, whatever it is wearing, and teaching goes
 * behind the (?) beside the heading it belongs to.
