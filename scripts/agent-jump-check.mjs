/**
 * The ways out of an agent's settings to the things it names.
 *
 * Issue #251, and "yet another" is the whole of it: the same report had already
 * been made about a function's object parameter, a trigger's three pickers, an
 * action's four and a condition's one, and each time one form was fixed. This
 * form names five kinds of thing - a model, memory catalogs, skill catalogs,
 * tools and MCP servers - and pointed at none of them, so all five are driven
 * here rather than the one somebody happened to photograph.
 *
 * What is asserted is the same shape the other jump checks assert: the mark
 * appears only where there is something real to open, it points where the route
 * says it should, it opens a tab of its own, and the form it was pressed from
 * is left exactly as it was. With one addition this form needs and the others
 * do not - **pressing it must not grant anything.** Every grant row is a
 * checkbox in a label, and a press inside a label is a press the browser can
 * forward to that label's control, so a mark put carelessly would grant the
 * thing it was asked to explain.
 *
 * Both frames, for the reason `agent-grants-check` gives: the settings page and
 * the workflow editor's left panel are one `AgentForm` painted with class names
 * the frame hands in, and the two marks that sit beside a label are drawn with
 * exactly those. A frame that forgot one is a form with no way out in half the
 * places it is shown.
 *
 * It writes two things: an MCP server to name, so the row naming something
 * registered can be told from the row naming nothing, and - since the list
 * draws the workspace rather than a box to type into - that second grant on the
 * agent itself. Both are put back at the end, and any server left behind by a
 * killed run is swept at the start.
