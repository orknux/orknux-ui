/**
 * An installation with chat switched off stops offering chat's settings.
 *
 * Issue #201. The switch is on the admin's settings screen and it already did
 * most of its job: the Chat tab goes, Quick actions stops listing it, and the page
 * itself says an administrator turned it off. What stayed behind was the
 * workspace's own Chat card - a model for naming chats, a model for the
 * microphone in a chat, a model to read an answer in a chat aloud - three
 * settings for a screen nobody in that installation can open, sitting on the
 * page an administrator goes to next.
 *
 * The Quick Chat model is deliberately not among them and is asserted to stay.
 * The AI button is a different feature under the same word: the server's flag
 * governs `ChatAPI` and `ChatStreamAPI` and nothing else, the manual says the
 * switch "takes the tab away and refuses new messages", and what decides
 * whether the button is offered is the workspace's own "None - the AI button is
 * not offered". Hiding its model with chat's would take away the only way to
 * turn off something that still works.
 *
 * The switch is flipped over GraphQL and put back in a `finally`, whatever
 * happens in between: this runs against a real installation, and a check that
 * leaves chat off is a check that broke the thing it was measuring.
