/**
 * A picture in the manual opens larger when it is clicked.
 *
 * Issue #217. The manual is forty-six screenshots of this application, drawn
 * into a column some seven hundred pixels wide - so a picture of a screen 1440
 * across arrives at about half size, and the field names it was taken to show
 * are unreadable. There was nothing to do about it but open the file in a tab
 * by hand, which loses the page the picture was explaining.
 *
 * What is measured is the size, because that is the whole request. The picture
 * on the page is measured, clicked, and the picture in the viewer is measured:
 * a viewer that opens and draws the same 700px picture has not zoomed anything.
 * The alt text is asserted to travel with it, since that sentence is the
 * caption saying what is being looked at, and Escape is asserted to close it -
 * a `<dialog>` gives that for free, and a div over the page does not.
