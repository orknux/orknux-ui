 *
 * Against the shipped image rather than the dev server - the way CI runs it -
 * reach it as localhost and not as host.docker.internal: Chromium trusts the
 * first with a microphone and not the second, and the voice checks measure
 * whether one is offered at all. The container has no localhost:18099 of its
 * own, so forward one to the host first, in the background:
 *
 *   docker exec -d orknux-ui-dev-1 node scripts/suite/forward.mjs 18099
 *
 * then ORKNUX_UI_URL=http://localhost:18099, the same as CI's BASE.
 *
 * Each check is a process of its own rather than a function called in this one.
 * That is deliberate and it is what makes the timeout below mean anything: a
 * check that hangs waiting for a selector that will never appear is killed and
 * reported, and the ones after it still run. In one process the first hang ends
 * the suite and everything behind it is simply unknown.
 *
 * Output is collected rather than streamed, so a passing check prints one line
 * and a failing one prints one line and then everything it said. The whole
 * point of a suite is that a green run is short enough to read.
 *
 * The JUnit file at the end is for the same reason the server's suite writes
 * one: GitHub renders it, and "SOME FAILED" in a log twelve thousand lines down
 * is not a report.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The proxy stall, and why a timeout here is now worth believing
 *
 * Against the development server these checks speak to vite on 5173, which
 * proxies /graphql and /api to the server on 8080. That proxy used to stall: a
 * few requests in a thousand hung for thirty-five seconds, which from inside a
 * check reads as a `waitForSelector` that never resolves or a screen reported
 * as having drawn nothing - indistinguishable from a real defect, and the cause
 * of three false bug reports in a day. Issue #163 is the whole account of it.
 *
 * It was the connection, not the proxy. Vite opened a new one to the server for
 * every request it forwarded; from the container that crossing loses a SYN
 * every few hundred attempts, and the wait is then Linux's retry ladder -
 * 1s, 3s, 7s, 15s, 31s. `orknux-ui/vite.config.ts` now hands the proxy a
 * keep-alive agent, so it makes the crossing about once per hundred requests
 * instead of once per request. Same query, 1600 times each way at four in
 * flight, before and after:
 *
 *   through vite, before : median 20ms, p99 1291ms, max 35.7s, 2 unanswered
 *   through vite, after  : median  8ms, p99  169ms, max  0.9s, none over 2s
 *
 * So: a check that times out here is now much more likely to be telling the
 * truth. Run it again once to be sure - the machine can still be busy - but do
 * not write a timeout off as the proxy without looking, and if the long hangs
 * come back, measure the connection rather than the check.
