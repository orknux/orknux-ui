/**
 * Which checks there are, and what each one needs before it can be believed.
 *
 * The list is here rather than a glob over the folder so that adding a file is
 * a decision: a script somebody wrote to measure something once should not
 * become a test in CI because it happened to be saved in this directory.
 *
 * `needs` is the honest part. Nearly every one of these drives the real
 * interface against a real server, and they differ in what has to be in that
 * server's database first:
 *
 *   'nothing'   - no server at all. A check that reads the source, or asks a
 *                 compiler about something the interface generates, and would
 *                 only be putting a browser between itself and the answer.
 *   'session'   - an account and nothing else. Runs anywhere the product runs.
 *   'workspace' - a workspace with the ordinary furniture: functions, tools,
 *                 conditions, connections, issues. The seed builds this.
 *   'workflow'  - a workflow with nodes and lines in it, opened in the editor.
 *   'fixture'   - something more particular than the two above; see the note.
 *   'model'     - a model that answers. CI has none, and neither does the
 *                 developer machine this was written on while its stored
 *                 secrets are unreadable. Never run unattended.
 *
 * `ci: false` means exactly one thing: this check is not run by the CI job. The
 * reason is written beside it, and it is never "it is flaky".
 *
 * `budget: <ms>` raises the runner's timeout for one check. The default is a
 * hang-catcher and sits near what the slowest healthy check takes, so a check
 * that is legitimately longer than that has to say so rather than have every
 * other check's hang-catcher loosened around it. One check asks, and the
 * reason is beside it.
 *
 * `alone: true` means this check changes something the whole installation
 * shares, so nothing may run beside it. Sharding hands each worker its own
 * workspace, which covers everything a check normally touches; it does not
 * cover a switch in Admin or the language on the account every worker signs in
 * as. Two checks are in that position and both say so.

     * seconds goes on saying 2.5 seconds after that file says something else,

     * here would notice.

     * The second is why this drives audio at all. A setting that is stored and
     * never read is worse than no setting, and every other assertion here would
     * pass on a page that saved three numbers nothing consults. So the panel is

     * longer would pass on a slow machine.

     * Four assertions carry it, and they are written to fail rather than to
     * quietly stop meaning anything. There is no refresh control on the page,
     * so growth cannot be a poll. A marker on `window` survives, so growth
     * cannot be a reload. The line count and what the page says it is doing are
     * read in one evaluate, so "a line was there while it said Working" is one
     * moment rather than two readings a tenth of a second apart. And the count
     * of how long the model has been thinking is read, waited on and read
     * again - the shape `chat-working-check` was rebuilt around, because "the
     * thinking is drawn" would pass just as well on a build that painted all of
     * it in one go at the end.
     *
     * **It used to say 'workspace' and mean it, and that was the bug.** The
     * fixture was a model pointed at `.invalid`, on the reasoning `task-check`
     * gives: the prompt is written into the log before the model is asked, so
     * the session gets lines either way. True, and not enough. Measured, such a
     * task is forty milliseconds end to end and writes three lines, so there is
     * no "while" to catch - the page usually draws after it is already over,
     * and where it does not, everything left arrives inside one frame. What
     * used to be here was a retry loop that started up to four tasks hoping to
     * catch one running; the first time this check was ever executed it lost
     * that lottery four times out of four.
     *
     * So the fixture is a model that takes its time, which is also the only
     * kind that has any thinking to draw. `scripts/suite/reasoning-stub.py`
     * emits `reasoning_content` over twelve seconds and then calls `task_done`.
     * It cannot be stubbed in the browser, for the reason `image-model-check`
     * gives about its own: the thinking is produced by the server calling a
     * provider, written into the task's session and followed over a stream, so
     * a stub in the page would be a check of the stub.
     *
     * That is what `ci: false` costs and buys. CI keeps `task-check`, which
     * proves a task's machinery and needs nothing; what it gives up is a check
     * that could only ever have passed by luck. Run this by hand:
     *
     *   python scripts/suite/reasoning-stub.py 8198
     *   node scripts/suite/run.mjs --only task-live-check
     *
     * Where the stub is, as the server reaches it, goes in
     * ORKNUX_REASONING_STUB.
