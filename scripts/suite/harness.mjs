/**
 * The plumbing every check in this folder had a copy of.
 *
 * Thirty scripts opened a browser, posted to /api/session as alice, kept a
 * `results` array, printed PASS/FAIL and exited 0 or 1 - each in its own
 * slightly different words, and each with its own idea of where a screenshot
 * goes. None of that is the value of a check; the assertions are. So the
 * assertions stayed exactly where they were written and only this moved.
 *
 * What a check now says at the top:
 *
 *   import { BASE, WORKSPACE, open, record, finish } from './suite/harness.mjs';
 *   const { browser, page } = await open();
 *
 * and at the bottom:
 *
 *   await finish(browser);            // pass if everything recorded passed
 *   await finish(browser, a, b);      // ...and if these are true as well
 *
 * `finish` is the only exit. It closes the browser first, so a check that fails
 * does not leave a chromium behind for the runner to wait on, and it prints one
 * summary line the runner reads back.
 *
 * And `drawn(page, name)`, for the other half of the same problem: a check that
 * reads a page which has not arrived is a check that asserts things about an
 * empty screen. See its own note below.

/**
 * Wait until a page has actually drawn something, and fail by name if it never
 * does.
 *
 * This is the shape that produced most of this suite's false alarms. A check
 * navigates, sleeps a fixed second and a half, and reads the page - and the
 * loader deliberately draws nothing for its first three seconds, so a page that
 * was merely slow is an *empty* page. Every assertion of the form "X is no
 * longer printed under a field" then passes on a blank screen, and the only
 * thing left to complain about is a missing control, which reads exactly like
 * prose deleted and never replaced. It sent somebody looking for a deletion
 * that was never made, twice.
 *
 * So: wait on the page rather than on the clock, and when nothing arrives, say
 * *that* - with what the page did hold, because a settings page asked for a
 * thing that is not there answers with a short card saying so, and a bare "drew
 * nothing" cannot tell that from a page that failed to render.
 *
 * **And wait for it to stop.** "Has drawn something" was the wrong question and
 * cost a day of chasing findings that were not there. Every page in this
 * product is drawn in two parts - the shell, which is text on screen in a
 * frame, and then the thing the page is about, which arrives when the server
 * answers. Asking only whether there was *any* text meant this returned on the
 * navigation down the side, and eight checks then measured a page that had not
 * loaded yet:
 *
 *   "10 per page draws 10 rows (drew 0)"        the rows had not arrived
 *   "the settings page has a Component history  the section had not arrived
 *    section"
 *   "the button is on Gemma 31B"                the model rows had not arrived
 *   "with chat on, the workspace offers chat's  `main` held 155 characters for
 *    own settings"                              the first three seconds
 *
 * Every one of those reads as the product having lost something. So a page is
 * drawn when its text is the same twice running, [still] apart - which is cheap,
 * needs no check to know what it is waiting for by name, and is exactly the
 * difference between "something is on screen" and "this is the answer".
 *
 * [still]`: 0` waives that for a page that is genuinely never still. Nothing
 * needs it today; it is here so that the one that does can say so out loud
 * rather than going back to the old behaviour for everybody.
 *
 * Returns true when the page drew, false when it did not - having already
 * recorded the failure, so the caller's job is only to stop reading.
