/**
 * Four status lines that were trimmed, and the sentences that had to go
 * somewhere.
 *
 * The rules file's test for a status: *if the sentence would still be true and
 * worth saying when the thing is full, it is not status.* Four lines failed it
 * - a bell, an issue's attachments, and the two trigger logs - each keeping one
 * sentence of state and one of teaching. And the corollary is the mistake the
 * trim invites: **do not delete the elaboration, move it.** A sentence said only
 * in a status line and then cut is a thing the product no longer says anywhere.
 *
 * So this is written the way that corollary asks for. For each of the four it
 * asserts both halves: the state is still printed in the open, and the sentence
 * that left the open is inside a `FieldHint` in the same file. Deleting the
 * second half rather than moving it fails here, and that is the whole reason
 * this check exists - `hint-prose-check` would be perfectly happy with a
 * deletion, since what it looks for is prose that is still in the open.
 *
 * The source half covers all four. The browser half covers the one of them that
 * can be reached without building or destroying anything: a new issue has no
 * attachments by definition. The bell's empty panel needs an account with no
 * notifications and the two trigger logs need a workspace nothing has ever
 * fired in, and manufacturing either against a real database means changing
 * somebody's data. That is said out loud here rather than left as three
 * assertions this file appears to make and does not.
