/**
 * Typing fast into the code editor, and the four things that are allowed to
 * write over what was typed.
 *
 * Issue #198. `CodeEditor` wrote its Monaco model back from its `value` prop on
 * every render where the two disagreed. A passive effect does not run at commit
 * - it is flushed after paint - so a keystroke that lands in that gap leaves the
 * effect holding a `value` one character behind the model it is about to
 * overwrite. `setValue` then replaces the document with the older text and sends
 * the caret to the top, mid-word, and the next characters land wherever the
 * caret now is. Driven at a 15ms key delay, "export default async function"
 * came back as "';n 'o' retu) 4154262ion1787".
 *
 * That is why this check types with a delay rather than with `insertText`.
 * `insertText` is one input event and cannot race anything, which is exactly why
 * every check in this suite that used it - and Playwright's own default typing
 * speed, which is slower than a person - went on passing while the editor
 * scrambled real text. The measurement here is the whole typed string compared
 * character for character against what the editor is holding afterwards.
 *
 * Typing is only half of it. The prop is also how four legitimate writers put
 * code into this editor, and a fix that simply stopped writing would break all
 * four, silently:
 *
 *   the panel      - a parameter added on the right rewrites the declaration on
 *                    the left, because the server refuses to save a function
 *                    whose code cannot accept what it is handed. Only while the
 *                    panel is ahead of the server (issue #175, `panelMoved`), so
 *                    this check asserts both halves: nothing is rewritten on a
 *                    load, and the rewrite lands when a parameter really is added
 *   a suggestion   - the assistant's change, accepted in the bar over the diff
 *   a revision     - restoring a version from the History panel, which writes
 *                    into the editor already on screen
 *   another one    - opening a different function, whose code has to replace what
 *                    the last one left there
 *
 * Everything here is this check's own, made and deleted over GraphQL, and swept
 * at the start in case an earlier run was killed before it could delete.
 *
 * The split is pushed to its narrowest panel before anything is typed. Not
 * cosmetic: the editor wraps rather than scrolls, and a wrapped line is several
 * `.view-line` elements carrying an indent nobody typed, so a line long enough
 * to wrap cannot be read back character for character. Both typed lines are kept
 * well inside what the column holds, and the check counts the rendered lines
 * before believing either comparison.
