/**
 * Takes the screenshots the manual uses.
 *
 * A script rather than a folder of images somebody once made by hand, because
 * documentation screenshots rot faster than the prose around them: a button
 * moves, a column is renamed, and the picture goes on showing last year's
 * product while the paragraph beside it is correct. Regenerating has to be one
 * command or it never happens.
 *
 * That command is in the other repository, because most of what it does is not
 * a browser. From PowerShell, in a checkout of orknux-server:
 *
 *   .\scripts\screenshots.ps1 -Endpoint http://a.model.that/answers
 *
 * It builds the jar, stands an installation of its own up around it, seeds it,
 * runs this inside its interface container, and takes it all down again. Read
 * the top of that script before running either half by hand: the traps that
 * cost the most are not visible from here — the browser's origin has to be the
 * one `ORKNUX_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` names, or every call from the page answers 403
 * while curl is served perfectly, and the jar has to be built from the tree
 * being photographed, because Monitoring prints the version it was built at.
 *
 * By hand, against an installation that script has already stood up:
 *
 *   docker compose -f scripts/screens-compose.yaml exec ui node scripts/seed-demo.mjs
 *   docker compose -f scripts/screens-compose.yaml exec ui node scripts/screenshots.mjs
 *
 * There is no playwright install line any more: the browser and the system
 * libraries it needs live in the container's own filesystem rather than in the
 * node_modules volume, so a recreated container loses them — which is why that
 * container's own command puts them back rather than a person remembering to.
 *
 * The endpoint matters more than it looks. Half a dozen of these pictures are
 * of a product talking to a model - a chat with an answer in it, a run with an
 * agent step, a provider with a green light - and pointed at nothing they are
 * pictures of a 404. It also has to be a model with tool support, or the agent
 * that answers by calling something answers by apologising. Whatever it is
 * pointed at, its address is replaced in every image before the shutter: see
 * `hideEverywhere` below, which does the same for the address of whoever is
 * taking the pictures.
 *
 * The seed comes first and is not optional. These pictures used to be taken of
 * whatever was in the developer's database, which is how the manual ended up
 * showing a workflow called `dgd`; now the content is built on purpose and this
 * finds it by name.
 *
 * The credentials are the ones seeded into the directory in orknux-server's
 * `docker/ldap/bootstrap.ldif` — the same file the installation being
 * photographed is seeded from. They are in that repository in plain text on
 * purpose, and they are of no use anywhere else.
