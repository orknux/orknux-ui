/**
 * How long component history is kept, set on the Admin screen.
 *
 * The owner asked for fourteen days by default and configurable, which is a
 * setting rather than a constant — and a setting nobody can reach is a
 * constant with extra steps. So this drives the field the way a person does:
 * reads what is on screen, types a different number, presses Save, reloads, and
 * asserts the reloaded page shows the number that was typed rather than the one
 * it started with. A field bound to state that never round-trips to the server
 * passes every unit test and fails exactly this.
 *
 * It also checks the two things that are easy to leave off a number field: that
 * the Save button is dead while the value is the stored one, so pressing it is
 * never a no-op write, and that a value outside the range is refused with a
 * sentence rather than stored.
 *
 * Puts the original number back before it exits, whichever way it went.
