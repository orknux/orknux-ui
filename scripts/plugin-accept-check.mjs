/**
 * Loading a plugin that asks for something, stopped at the question and loaded
 * on the answer.
 *
 * The load used to die instead of asking, when what the plugin asked for was a
 * capability: the permissions refusal carried its list to the screen and the
 * capabilities refusal surfaced as a 500 carrying nothing, so a plugin updated
 * to ask the server for one more thing could not be loaded at all. The two are
 * one question now, and this measures the whole path: both lists drawn, each
 * under its own sentence — a permission relaxes the sandbox, a capability asks
 * the server to act, and neither may be agreed to under cover of the other —
 * and one press of Allow and Load sending both kinds of names back.
 *
 * The plugin is this check's own, under a key nobody would mistake for real,
 * and it is unloaded at the end; a row an earlier killed run left behind is
 * swept at the start.
