/**
 * Issue #295: a model on the Models screen can be made into an agent, in one
 * press.
 *
 * The other half of taking the bare model away. Before it, "I have just added a
 * model — does it work?" was a chat, a picker and a sentence typed. After it,
 * with nothing else, it would have been: go to Agents, add one, name it, open
 * its settings, choose the model, save, go to Chat, pick it, type, and then
 * decide what to do with the agent you did not want. This is that path put back
 * to one press, and what it leaves behind is a real agent rather than something
 * to throw away.
 *
 * ## What is measured, and why each of these and not fewer
 *
 * **The button is on a chat model's row and not on any other's.** An agent
 * pointed at a transcription model fails on its first message, and the server
 * refuses to make one — a button that is there to be refused is worse than no
 * button. Both halves are asserted because a fix that put the button on every
 * row would pass the first alone.
 *
 * **Pressing it lands on the new agent's settings page.** Not on a chat: what
 * was made is an agent, its name was derived rather than chosen, and it has been
 * granted nothing, which are three things to look at before talking to it. And a
 * chat would mean a conversation in the sidebar every time anybody checked a
 * model.
 *
 * **The agent is on that model, and named after it.** The name is the part
 * somebody sees first and the part most likely to be quietly wrong.
 *
 * **It is granted nothing.** Read off the API rather than the page, because
 * this is the assertion that matters most and the settings page draws several of
 * these grants as absences that look the same as a page that has not loaded.
 * Granting is a deliberate act; an action that handed out tools because it was
 * being helpful would be the worst possible place in this product to be
 * generous.
 *
 * Everything this check makes is deleted again.
