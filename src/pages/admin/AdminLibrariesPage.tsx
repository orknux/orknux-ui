 * `usedBy` is why this screen is an administrator's rather than a workspace's. It
 * names every function and tool importing a library across every workspace, which
 * is what somebody deciding whether to replace or remove one has to know, and it
 * is the only place in the product that can answer it.
 *
 * There are two ways in and one kind of row. A file somebody chose, and a package
 * somebody named — and what the second produces is the same stored artefact as the

 * drawn only where a registry is configured: an installation with no way out

                A library is available in every workspace, and is imported by a function or a tool under a
                local name of its own — <code>imports.dateFns</code>. Its key is the filename without the
                extension, so loading a file with a key already in the list replaces it in place and nothing
                importing it is repointed. One that something imports cannot be removed.
                <br />
                <br />
                Installing a package fetches it once, here on the server, into this database — the file is
                what is stored and what runs, and nothing reaches a registry afterwards. Name an exact
                version, never <code>latest</code>: a version that resolves differently tomorrow is not an
                answer to what code is running here. A package has to publish one self-contained file. An ES
                module is taken as it is and a CommonJS one is given its <code>module</code> and{' '}
                <code>exports</code> as it runs, so <code>main</code> and a UMD bundle both work.

                <br />
                A package that is more than one file, or that needs a second package, is not refused: it is
                offered as a bundle, with the packages and the versions their ranges resolved to, and made
                into one file if you say so. The files go in as they are and what went in is listed on the
                row — but a bundle is an artefact this installation assembled, so nothing outside it can be
                compared with the result. Choosing several files at once bundles them the same way, and asks
                which one it is entered by.
