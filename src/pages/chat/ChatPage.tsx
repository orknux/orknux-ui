   * for keeping it is weaker, not stronger: it is the model talking to itself,
   * it is never sent back to the model, and nothing downstream reads it.
   *
   * The lookups are the exception that proves it. They *are* kept, because they
   * were already being kept for another reason: an agent chat records its round
   * into an LLM session, which is a transcript in its own right, and the log
   * puts them back off that when the page loads. So a reload keeps the calls and
   * loses the thinking, which is exactly what each of them is worth.
   *
   * ## Cleared at the start of a turn, not at the end of one
   *
   * It stays on screen once the answer lands: somebody reads the answer and then

   * the top of the window and the growth never stops. At the cap - the top of

   * grow past the top on the first Shift+Enter.

                its model's name — read off the chat as `modelName`, not out of

                      Outside is the whole point. The copy control below copies
                      `shownTake`, the speech model is handed `shownTake`, and
                      the next turn sends the thread — none of which holds any
                      of this, so none of them has to remember to leave it out.
                      A reasoning model's thinking read aloud is the bug this
                      replaces, not a risk it introduces.

                      nowhere else: nothing is recorded, so an answer further up
                      the log has none and would draw an empty container
                      claiming otherwise. The calls are the exception and they
                      come back on their own, off the session, as `tool` lines
                      in the log above.
