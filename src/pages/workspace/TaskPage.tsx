            Saying something to a task nobody stopped.

            Under what it is waiting for and above what it is doing, which is
            where it belongs in the order of the page: a parked task has one
            thing somebody must decide and this is not it, and a message is
            about the work below rather than about the prompt above.

            Offered whether the task is going or over, and it means something
            different in each - which is why the words change and the control
            does not.

            While it works it changes what is being produced. Afterwards it sets
            the task going again on the same session, so "make the third stanza
            shorter" is this piece of work continued rather than a new task that
            has to be told the whole job by somebody who just watched it be
            done. The box used to be hidden here, and starting again from
            nothing was the only route.

            What was said outlives either. A message that was never read stays
            on screen after the task ends, because the alternative is what
            happened on task 30: somebody's correction disappeared with the card
            and left no sign anywhere that it had been typed.

                    The one being written is drawn open, because seeing the
