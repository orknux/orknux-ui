/**
 * How big a step's box is, said rather than discovered.
 *
 * React Flow draws a node it has no measurement for with `visibility: hidden`,
 * and it throws every measurement away whenever the node objects are replaced -
 * which this page does on every read of the run, because the objects are built
 * from the answer. Normally the browser measures them again on the next frame
 * and nobody sees the gap. When the read lands in the same batch as the
 * measurement it did land, React never renders the state in between, the effect
 * that would observe the boxes again never re-runs, and the ResizeObserver has
 * no size change to report - so the nodes stay hidden for as long as the page is
 * open. That is the empty graph: four boxes, positioned, framed, and invisible.
 *
 * The size was never worth discovering. Every line in the box is one ellipsised
 * row, so it is exactly this size whatever the run put in it - the stylesheet
 * fixes the width and four rows fix the height. Given up front, there is no
 * state in which a node has no size, and no frame in which one is not drawn.
 *
 * It is given twice, and the second time is issue #259. `initialWidth` answers
 * "how big is a box nothing has measured yet", which is what decides whether a
 * node is drawn; `measured` answers "this box has been measured", which is what
 * decides whether the *lines* are drawn. React Flow keeps where a node's handles
 * are in its own bookkeeping, and it keeps them across a rebuild only for a node
 * whose object carries `measured` - `parseHandles` in @xyflow/system throws them
 * away for a node that does not. An edge is nothing but two handle positions, so
 * an edge whose node has none is not drawn at all: nodes on the canvas, no lines
 * between them, which is precisely what was reported.
 *
 * That is why the #235 fix did not cover this. It made the boxes appear and left
 * the lines behind them, and every read of the run erased all of them for a
 * frame - and for good whenever the frame that would put them back never came,
 * which is the same race #235 and #242 were about. These nodes are exactly as
 * tall as this says, so nothing is being claimed here that a measurement would
 * contradict; the editor's nodes hand `measured` back through `onNodesChange`
 * and this page, which has no such door, says it itself.

/**
 * Frames the graph on what is actually drawn.

 * React Flow's own `fitView` does nothing in this canvas. It fits to the sizes it
 * has measured, and it never measures these nodes: `useNodesInitialized` reports
 * false forever, with the nodes rendered, absolutely positioned at their
 * coordinates, 200x92 each, and their handles in place. Every route into the fit
 * therefore did nothing — the `fitView` prop, which fits on initialisation, and the
 * two effects that called `fitView` themselves. The viewport kept its identity
 * transform, and a run wider than the card showed two of its four steps with
 * nothing to say the others were off to the right.
 *
 * So the viewport is computed here instead, from the one source that is definitely
 * right: the elements on the page. Each node carries its own `translate(x, y)` in
 * flow coordinates, and `offsetWidth`/`offsetHeight` are layout sizes, unaffected
 * by the scale on the ancestor — so the extent of the graph can be read off the DOM
 * whatever React Flow believes. `setViewport` only sets a transform and needs no
 * measurement of its own, which is why it works where `fitView` does not.
