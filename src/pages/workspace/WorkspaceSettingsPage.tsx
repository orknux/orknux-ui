At Default nothing is decided and those agents get a fixed built-in allowance, which is what every workspace does until somebody sets this.

            The refusal, or what the share means - never both.

            Which of three things is drawn is the whole of this card's honest
            problem, so it is worth saying plainly:

            - refused: the bounds sentence, in the server's own words. The track
              cannot reach a share outside them, so this is the safety net for
              the ceiling above having drifted from the server's - and it is the
              only thing here that turns Save off.
            - Default: the built-in allowance's own figures, which is exactly
              what agents get when the workspace decides nothing, and the one
              case where the figures depend on no model at all. There is nothing
              to work them out against, so nothing is offered to choose.
            - a share: what it works out to against one model, named. This is
              the honest difficulty of this setting - a share that is generous
              on a 200,000-token window is impossible on an 8,000-token one, and
              the server deliberately refuses a default on account of neither -
              and the answer taken here is to show it rather than to hide it or
              to invent a refusal this screen does not own. The figures are one
              model's and say whose; the picker changes which model, and changes
              nothing that is saved.
