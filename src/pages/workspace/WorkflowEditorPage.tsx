 * One point keeps the quadratic it has always had, and the reason is worth
 * keeping with it. The bend was once drawn as two half-beziers - in to the
 * point from its left, out of it to the right - and forcing those two sides
 * made the shape jump the moment the point was touched: a line that had been
 * nearly straight became a wide S, because each half now had to leave and
 * arrive horizontally, and a pixel of drag moved the line much further than a
 * pixel. Pulled back past its own source it curled into a loop with the handle
 * inside it, which is not something anybody can drag straight again. A
 * quadratic has no such preference: its control point is placed so the curve
 * passes through exactly where the handle was put - B(0.5) is the point when
 * the control sits at twice the point less the midpoint of the ends. So the
 * common case by far is drawn today exactly as it was drawn yesterday, and
 * adding this feature moves nobody's existing line by a pixel.
 *
 * More than one needs a scheme that joins them, and that is the spline above -
 * which is held to the same standard: it passes through its points, and none
 * of it leaves or arrives in a direction it was not given.

 * How small a node can be, said before anything has measured one.
 *
 * React Flow draws a node it has no measurement for with `visibility: hidden`,
 * and it recognises the node it measured by the object - so replacing the node
 * objects throws every measurement away. Normally the browser measures the boxes
 * again on the next frame and nobody sees the gap. When the replacement lands in
 * the same batch as the measurement that did land, React never renders the state
 * in between, the effect that would observe the boxes again never re-runs, its
 * ResizeObserver has no size change to report, and the nodes stay hidden until
 * the page is reloaded. That was #235 on the run's graph, and this canvas is
 * built the same way.
 *
 * It is safer here only by where the rebuilds are. React Flow writes `measured`
 * back onto the nodes through `onNodesChange`, so every path that rebuilds the
 * array by spreading what is already in it - undo, redo, adding a node, copying
 * one, the ports and panel effects - hands the measurement straight back.
 * `loadGraph` is the one that does not, because it builds the objects out of the
 * server's answer, and it runs on opening the editor and on Discard. That is a
 * property of today's call sites rather than a guard, so the nodes now carry a
 * size up front and there is no state in which one has none.
 *
 * These are the numbers the stylesheet and the resizer already agree on: `.node`
 * is `min-width: 220px; min-height: 96px` and `NodeResizer` refuses to go below
 * the same. They are a floor, not a size - a node grows to fit what it holds, so
 * one frame of a tall node drawn at its minimum is possible and a node drawn at
 * nothing is not. And a node somebody widened by hand carries `width` and
 * `height` of its own, which React Flow prefers over both of these wherever it
 * asks: in `nodeHasDimensions`, and in the inline size it puts on the element.

   *   - the action names a connection, which is what the run sends through. A
   *     node cannot override it: it binds what is said and who it goes to, and
   *     the connection stays the definition's. So the definition is where the
   *     answer to "which connection" is, and there is nowhere else to look.
   *   - that connection is a Slack one. Only Slack can be asked about a user or
   *     a channel, and the action carries the connection's id and name but not
   *     its type, which is why the workspace's connections are held above.
   *
   * Null wherever any of that cannot be established - an action that has not
   * loaded yet, a definition naming no connection, a connection this browser
   * has not been told the type of - and null means nothing is said. Guessing
   * would put a sentence about some other connection under the field, or claim
   * a channel cannot be seen without knowing who was asked.
   *
   * **Which kind is named is nobody's business here, and used to be a fourth
   * thing.** The definition carried a Channel/User setting, an action whose
   * setting was never made left it null, and this concluded from that that there
   * was nobody to ask - so the panel asked nothing and drew nothing, which is
   * issue #176 as it was reported: somebody whose bot token was missing
   * `users:read` was told so by silence, and silence is indistinguishable from a
   * connection nobody has anything to say about. The kind only ever chose which
   * of Slack's two endpoints did the looking up; the setting is gone, sending
   * resolves the name it is given, and both endpoints are read for every
   * question. The one thing that still silences this panel is the one thing that
   * always should: no Slack connection to ask.

                                  send worth varying per step.

                                  Every parameter is drawn by it and only the
                                  target is asked about. Handed no connection it

                                  about what an ordinary parameter looks like.
                                  A function's argument may perfectly well be
