 * on both: a link made here appears on the issue it names, phrased from that
 * issue's side, without anybody going there to write the other half.
 *
 * Finding the far end is a search rather than a box to paste an id into,
 * because issues are said out loud as numbers here - the same `#124` the
 * comments already turn into a link - so that is what the box looks for first.
 *
 * The status of the issue at the far end is shown beside it, and that is not
 * decoration: "blocked by #4" is only worth reading if it also says whether #4
 * is still open.
