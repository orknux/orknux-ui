 * One picture, opened over the page it was drawn in.
 *
 * The manual is written in a column about seven hundred pixels wide and
 * illustrated with screenshots of a 1440-wide application, so every picture in
 * it arrives at roughly half size and the field names it was taken to show are
 * unreadable. Opening the file in a tab is the only thing that was left, and
 * that loses the sentence the picture belongs to.
 *
 * Not [AttachmentViewer], which is the same gesture over different material: an
 * attachment is a row with an id, a filename and a size, stepped through with
 * the arrow keys and offered as a download. A picture in the prose has none of
 * those — it has an address and a caption — and passing it through that
 * component would mean inventing a filename and a byte count to put in the bar.
 * What they do share is the reason for a native `<dialog>`: Escape closes it,
 * focus stays inside and returns where it was, and it draws in the top layer,
 * so nothing here has to have an opinion about z-index.
