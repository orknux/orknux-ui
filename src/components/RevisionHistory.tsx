        `UI-DESIGN-RULES.md`: an explanation goes behind a question mark beside
        the thing it explains, and this was a paragraph of it under a heading -
        printed to everybody who opened an editor, for the one reader who ever
        wondered where old versions go. On the heading rather than on a row,
        because it explains the whole panel.

        The sentence below it stayed where it is on purpose - but only the half
        of it that is a sentence about this component. "Nothing yet." is the
        state; "the next save will keep what this says now, and it will appear
        here" was the panel teaching how it fills, said a second time three
        inches under a control that exists to say exactly that. It is folded
        into the note above rather than deleted: "and it appears here" is the
        same fact, said once.
