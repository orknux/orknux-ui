/**
 * Export and Import for a workspace's catalogue.
 *
 * Two controls, on every list that holds something a file can carry. The export
 * asks how much to take before it takes it, and the import says what it will do
 * before it does it — a button that silently creates nine things is worse than
 * one that lists them first, which is the whole reason the plan is a separate
 * round trip rather than a return value.
 *
 * Half the catalogue points at something no file can carry: a model, a
 * connection, an MCP server, each of them kept beside a credential. Those arrive
 * as questions rather than as failures, and answering one is asking for the same
 * plan again with the answer attached — which is why the dialog owns the plan
 * rather than being handed one.
 *
 * Leaving a component out is the same shape again: it is asking for the same
 * plan without it. And it is offered on exactly the rows where it means
 * something — the ones the file *carries*. The other half of a plan is
 * references: names the envelope points at and never held, which have to be
 * matched against this workspace or bound to one of its rows. There is nothing
 * of those in the file, so there is nothing to remove, and a control offering to
 * remove one would be worse than no control at all.
