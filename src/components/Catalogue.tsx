/**
 * A list of the workspace's things, and the difference between having none of
 * them and not being able to find out.
 *
 * Half the screens in the app fill a picker from a catalogue - the models a
 * chat may speak to, the tools an agent may run, the connections an action may
 * send through - and every one of them was written the same way:
 *
 *     fetchWorkspaceTools(workspaceId).then(setTools).catch(() => setTools([]));
 *
 * which turns "the server did not answer" into "there are none", and then the
 * panel prints *No tools in this workspace yet*. That sentence is an invitation
 * to go and make one. It is exactly the wrong thing to say to somebody whose
 * session has just expired with a workspace full of tools behind it, and it is
 * the wrong thing said at the worst moment: a session that ends while the page
 * is open empties every picker at once, which reads as a workspace that has
 * been wiped.
 *
 * The two states want opposite things from the reader, so they are two states
 * here. `useCatalogue` keeps the failure instead of swallowing it, and
 * `CatalogueNote` prints one sentence or the other in the place the empty state
 * already occupied.
 *
 * It is one shape rather than a sentence per screen because the loading was
 * already one shape: every one of these is a workspace id, one fetch, an array,
 * and a picker that has nothing in it until the array arrives. Where a screen
 * does something else with the answer - choose a default, fill in a name from
 * the row it was started from - that is `onLoaded`, and the screen keeps it.
