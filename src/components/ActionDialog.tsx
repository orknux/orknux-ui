 * The action editor beside a graph, for the one door where a page is the wrong

 *
 * The actions list no longer opens this — an action has its own page now, the
 * way a condition got one in issue #87 — and that is the door a page belongs to,
 * because there the action *is* what somebody came to work on.
 *
 * What is left is the workflow editor's node panel. Somebody there is
 * configuring a node that points at this action, and the graph is the reason
 * they are reading it at all: sending them to a page would take away the thing
 * that gives the settings their meaning, and bring them back to a canvas whose
 * unsaved layout had to survive the trip. So the panel opens the definition
 * *beside* the graph, which is what `placement="panel"` is and what the editor's
 * own comment beside the trigger and condition panels says.
 *
 * Both surfaces render `ActionForm`, so there is one form and not two that
 * drift. What the page has and this does not is the `Used by` panel and a
 * Danger Zone — see `ActionSettingsPage`.
 *
 * The form is mounted only while this is open, and keyed by which action it
 * holds, which is what resets it: it reads its fields as it mounts, so the next
 * action opened starts from that action's own values without anything having to
 * put them back.
