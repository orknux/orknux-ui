                platform draws it - the trigger form puts one on exactly this
                field, and the workflow editor's node panel puts one beside

                A tab of its own, which is the trigger form's answer to the same
                question and, more to the point, the only safe one here: this
                form holds unsaved edits, the function editor it leads to has
                nothing listening for a navigation away, and neither would say
                so before throwing the other's work out. It is also why the
                function editor's own way out to Variables opens a tab.

                Nothing to open while the picker is on a name: the function is
                created when the condition is saved, not before.

                something else, which the one shared list here could not.
