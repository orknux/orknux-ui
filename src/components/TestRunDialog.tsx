/**
 * Running a function, in a window opened from the mark in the corner.
 *
 * Issue #266, twice. The first answer was a section in the editor's side panel,
 * and it was the seventh of nine - 1,364px down a thousand-pixel column, which
 * is a feature nobody found. Moving it second was a stopgap and moving it here
 * is the answer: a run mark where the page's other actions are, and a window
 * with room for the fields and for what came back.
 *
 * What was already right about it is carried across whole:
 *
 * **Every field is a parameter with a type, offered as that type**, rather than
 * one JSON box. A number field is where somebody types a number, and asking
 * them to remember that a string needs quotes is asking them to do the editor's
 * job. The shapes that have no spelling as a plain word - map, array, an object
 * - are the exception and are typed as JSON, because that is what they are.
 *
 * **The externals are here, blank, and each one left blank is the workspace's
 * own value.** This reverses what it said first, which was that a grant belongs
 * to the function and a field for one would let a test be given a value the real
 * run would never see. That is true and it was not the whole picture: the
 * commonest thing anybody writes here is a check against a secret, the secret is
 * one nobody may read back, and a window that could only ever run it against the
 * stored value could not test the failing half at all - nor could it test
 * anything on a workspace where the variable has not been set yet. The person
 * doing it has the function's source open in the next column; withholding the
 * input to it was protecting nothing.
 *
 * What that costs is answered where it lands rather than by refusing: nothing
 * but this window can pass one - a node, a trigger and a workflow have no such
 * field - and the workspace's audit names the ones given by hand, so a run that
 * behaved differently from the real one cannot be read later as the real one.
 *
 * **It runs what is stored, not what is in the column.** The server is handed
 * an id and arguments and no source, so what runs is the saved function, in the
 * sandbox a workflow runs it in, with the workspace's variables it is granted
 * resolved the same way. This says so, and says so again when there is unsaved
 * work - otherwise a run that disagreed with the code on screen would read as
 * the run being wrong rather than as the code not having been saved. Every run
 * is recorded in the workspace's audit, because it leaves no run of its own.
 *
 * **A function nobody has saved yet says so here rather than being refused by a
 * mark that will not press.** The mark is drawn from the first moment, because
 * a control that appears only after the first save is a control somebody
 * writing their first function never learns exists - and the one place with
 * room to explain why it cannot run yet is this window, not a tooltip on a
 * button that browsers will not always show.
