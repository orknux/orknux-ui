 * is about rather than which page it is. It fell through to the front page
 * before, which meant every switch made from a chat dropped the person into
 * Flow (issue #250). One chat is still one particular thing, so `/chat/7` lands
 * on `/chat` exactly as one issue lands on the issue list.
 *
 * Everything else, including a page belonging to no workspace, goes to the
