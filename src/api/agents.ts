 * it one: a workspace's default is not tied to a model, so it is judged on the
 * bounds alone and `modelId` is ignored. What comes back then is the *bounds
 * verdict* and nothing else worth printing — the figures are the built-in
 * allowance's rather than the default's, because there is no window to work one
 * out against. A form wanting to show what a default would mean against one
 * particular model asks this same function again with that model and no flag,
