# Issues

Each workspace has a tracker of its own. An issue about a workflow belongs
beside the workflow, and the alternative - a link to another product - is a link
nobody follows while they are in the middle of fixing something.

It is small on purpose. There are no projects, no milestones, no boards and no
workflow of its own: a title, what is wrong, who is looking at it, and the
conversation underneath.

## The list

![The tracker: the states along the top, one search beside them, and the labels in use underneath](/screens/issues.png)

**Issues**, under **Workspace** in the menu down the left, opens it.

Four states along the top: **Open**, **In progress**, **Closed** and **All**.
Open is what you get when the address says nothing, because that is what
somebody arriving is looking for. In progress means somebody has picked it up;
open means nobody has yet.

One search box covers the **title, the description and the labels** together.
Somebody typing "slack" means any of the three, and asking which of the three
they meant is a question with no useful answer. It does not look inside
comments.

The labels in use in the workspace are listed under the filters. A label is a
search somebody has already typed, so clicking one puts it in the box and
clicking it again takes it out. That is also why only one applies at a time:
there is one search, not a search and a label filter arguing about the same
list.

Beside the states is a **type** box: **Any type**, one of the workspace's own
types, or **Untyped**. A select rather than the chips the labels get, because a
type list is short and closed and an issue has exactly one of them or none -
and because Untyped has to be something you can ask for. On a tracker that
existed before its types did, that is most of it.

**Sort** names the field it sorts on - **Number**, **Title**, **Last change**,
**Last comment**, **Type** - with a single arrow beside it for the direction. The arrow
says which way it is now rather than which way pressing it would go.

Number is the order things were filed in and not a date, which is why it is
called Number: a list ordered correctly by it reads as wrong against times that
run in no order at all. Last comment is deliberately not the same as Last
change, because closing, relabelling and assigning all move the change time, so
that ordering surfaces the housekeeping and this one surfaces the conversation.
An issue nobody has replied to sorts last either way round, there being no time
to put it in order by.

The row shows whichever time you sorted on, so an ordering can be checked
instead of taken on trust. The ordering is the server's, over the whole tracker
rather than over the rows on screen - sorting ten of a hundred looks like it
worked until the row somebody wanted turns out to be on page three.

The line at the bottom says how many there are and how many are shown, and the
page size sits in it: 10, 25, 50 or 100. It is remembered in your browser rather
than in the address, because it says how much of a screen you have and not what
you are looking at.

Everything else is in the address:

| Written | Means |
| --- | --- |
| `status` | one of the workspace's status keys - `OPEN`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `REVIEW`, `CLOSED` until it changes them - or `all`; absent means the first |
| `q` | what is in the search box |
| `order` | `NUMBER`, `TITLE`, `UPDATED` or `LAST_COMMENT` |
| `dir` | `asc`; anything else is descending |
| `page` | which page, counting from one |

So "the open p1 ones" is a link rather than a paragraph of instructions, and a
refresh comes back to the list you were reading instead of to the top of Open.

**New Issue** files one. If several are on your mind, tick **File another** and
the form empties and stays put, keeping the assignee and the labels you had just
set.

**Quick actions** knows the open issues too, by their title and by their
number, so typing `12` there finds #12 — and **Create issue** is in the same
list, for the one you notice while looking at something else.

## One issue

![An issue: what is wrong, what it points at, and the conversation underneath](/screens/issue.png)

An issue is addressed by the number people say. `/issues/38` is #38 of that
workspace, and numbers are counted per workspace, so every workspace has its own
#1.

The title and the description are edited in place: double-click the description
to write, and **Edit/Preview** turns between writing it and reading it as
markdown. The same toggle is on the description while a new issue is being
filed, on the comment box, and on the box for correcting a comment - a report is
written once and read by everybody afterwards, so the moment somebody most wants
to see how their markdown lands is before they have handed it over. All of them
go through the same renderer as the page itself, so a preview cannot differ from
what gets saved.

Down the right are the things somebody wants at a glance.

- **Status** is one button that cycles Open, In progress, Closed. There is also
  a **Close issue** button beside the comment box, where the decision usually
  gets made.
- **Assignee** is one box over three kinds of thing: a **person**, one of the
  workspace's **agents**, or one of its **models**. Work handed to an agent is
  still work somebody can see the state of, which is the whole reason the same
  box takes all three. Type to search it, and **No one** is both where it starts
  and a valid answer.
- **Type** is what the issue *is*: a bug, a feature, or whatever else this
  workspace files. One of them or none - **Untyped** is a real answer and where
  a new issue starts, because an issue nobody has classified should not be
  recorded as a bug by default. The list is the workspace's own and is edited in
  its settings, below.
- **Labels** are typed in, with what the workspace already uses suggested
  underneath. They have no colours and no meaning of their own - `p1` is a
  convention this project keeps, not a field. A label exists because an issue
  carries it, so removing the last one that used it removes it from the list.
  That is the difference from the type above it: a label is what somebody says
  *about* an issue, as many at once as they like, and it exists only while an
  issue holds it.
- **Observers**, under the labels, are whoever else asked to hear about it.
  Below.
- **Reporter** is whoever filed it, and is not editable.

A `#12` written in a description or a comment becomes a link to #12. Only on an
issue's own page, where a number after a hash is an issue and nothing else, and
only where it reads as one: inside code it is left alone, and so is anything
longer than five digits, which is a colour.

## Types

A workspace decides which kinds of thing it files. **Workspace → Settings →
Issues** holds the list; every workspace begins with **bug** and **feature**,
and an administrator can add, rename and remove them. Per workspace and not per
installation, because one team files bugs and features and the next files
incidents and requests.

Three things follow from a type being a thing the workspace keeps, rather than a
label with a `type:` in front of it:

- An issue has **one** or none. A set of labels cannot say "exactly one", so
  nothing would stop an issue being both a bug and a feature and no two readers
  would agree on what that meant.
- It **exists while nothing carries it**. A label only exists because an issue
  holds it, so there would be nothing to put on a settings page until somebody
  had already used it.
- It can be **renamed**, in one place. Every issue on it reads the new word at
  once, and nothing was rewritten - while the history keeps the word each change
  was made under, so renaming a type does not rewrite what happened last March.

Removing one is **refused while issues still carry it**, and the refusal says
how many; the count is on the row before you press anything. The way through is
the type filter on the list: ask for that type, retype what it finds, then
remove it. Nothing is untyped behind your back.

Issues filed before the workspace had types are **untyped**, and stay untyped. A
default would have been the tracker claiming a year of work was all bugs.

## History

![The History tab: what has happened to an issue, oldest
first](/screens/issue-history.png)

Below the header are two tabs: **Issue**, which is everything above, and
**History**, which is what has happened to it. Every line names somebody and
when: it being opened, comments, the status moving, the type being set or
changed, labels going on and coming off, it changing hands, and observers
arriving and leaving. The type is written down by the word it had at the time,
so renaming one afterwards does not rewrite what happened. Oldest first,
because it is read as a story.

The history is fetched when the tab is opened and not before, so an issue read
by somebody who never presses it costs exactly what it always did.

Two things it says out loud rather than leaving to be guessed. A comment shows
its first line, and pressing it goes to the comment itself on the Issue tab -
the conversation lives there, and a history that reprinted it would be a second
copy of the same page. And an issue that existed before this was recorded shows
the line where recording began: everything above it is what survived from before
- when it was opened, and what was said on it, because comments were always kept
- and everything below it was written down as it happened. An old issue showing
an empty history would be claiming a quiet week it never had.

Changes made by an assistant through the tools are in the same list, under the
name of whoever the assistant is signed in as.

## Observers

News about an issue used to reach exactly two people: whoever filed it and
whoever holds it. That is the right pair for work somebody has been handed, and
nobody at all for work that has not - an assistant filing what it found,
assigned to no one because handing out work is not its judgement, writes a
careful report into an empty room.

**Observers** are the people and agents who asked to hear about it anyway. An
observer gets everything the reporter and the assignee get: it being picked up,
closed, commented on, and reopened long after it was closed - which is the one
most worth having, since the person who cared about a bug is rarely still
looking at it the day it comes back.

Being an observer grants nothing. Anyone who can see the workspace can already
read the issue, so this is a subscription rather than a permission, and taking
somebody off does not shut them out of anything.

**Watch this issue** puts you on the list, and anybody who can see the workspace
may press it for themselves. Putting somebody *else* on, or taking them off,
needs the administrator role: a list anybody could add you to is a way to send
you mail, and one anybody could take you off is a way to keep news from you.
An administrator can take anybody off, including somebody who put themselves
on. That is deliberately not the rule that governs comments and files, where
only the person who put a thing there may remove it: those are a record of what
somebody said, and this is a subscription to news.

A person or an agent can observe; a **model cannot**. The assignee box takes all
three because work can be handed to any of them, but observing is a statement
about who reads, and a model has nowhere to read its news.

## Moving it elsewhere

An issue filed in the wrong workspace can be moved to the right one. **Move**,
beside the delete button on the issue, asks where it should go. Administrators
only, because a move takes an issue out of one team's tracker and puts it in
another's.

Its comments, labels, observers and files go with it, the files included:
the bytes are moved into the destination's own storage, so the screenshots still
open afterwards.

Its number does not go with it, and cannot. Numbers are counted per workspace,
so the issue is given one that is free where it lands, and the number it had is
free again for the next issue filed where it came from. Two things follow, and
the dialog says both before you press the button:

- The address people have been sending each other stops working. There is no
  redirect, deliberately - the old number will be handed to some other issue
  soon enough, and a redirect that eventually points away from a live issue is
  worse than one that was never there.
- A `#4` written in some other issue goes on pointing at whatever holds 4 where
  it was written. Nothing rewrites those: nothing can tell which of them meant
  this issue, and editing what other people wrote is not something this does.

So the move is recorded where somebody looking for it will find it. It is
written into the issue as a comment saying which workspace it came from and what
number it had, into the audit log of both workspaces, and sent to everybody
following the issue.

Some issues are refused rather than moved, and the refusal says what is in the
way. An issue assigned to an agent or a model of the workspace it is leaving has
no assignee where it is going, an observer that is such an agent would simply
stop hearing about it, and a link to another issue here cannot follow it at all
- so those are refused, naming what to change, rather than quietly cleared. People are never in the way: a person belongs to
the installation rather than to a workspace, and so does an `@name` written in a
comment.

## Links

Half of what a report points at is somewhere else: the pull request that caused
it, the dashboard that showed it, the page that will not load. Pasted into the
description those get buried in prose, so under **Links** each address gets a
row of its own, listed oldest first and taken off one at a time.

**Add a link** asks for the address and, optionally, what to call it. It is
offered while the issue is still being written as well as afterwards, because
the pull request and the failing page are what somebody has open at the moment
they decide to report something, and being told to file first and come back is
being told to lose the tab they were looking at. One typed then says "Added when
the issue is filed" rather than naming who added it, and is hung on the issue
the moment it exists.

A GitHub address is shown the way people say it: `owner/repo`,
`owner/repo#123` for an issue or a pull request, `owner/repo@abc1234` for a
commit. Both paths read as `#123` because GitHub numbers issues and pull
requests from one counter, so the address does not reliably say which it is.

That reading is worked out from the shape of the address alone and never asks
GitHub anything, which is worth being plain about: `owner/repo#123` means
"shaped like pull request 123", not "pull request 123 exists". A number nobody
ever opened reads exactly the same, and so does a repository you cannot see.
It is a label, and nothing here acts on it. Anything else - another host, a link
into a file - is shown as the address it is.

Only `http` and `https` addresses are kept. A link is rendered as an anchor
other people click, and `javascript:` in one is a script somebody else runs by
clicking what looks like a reference.

A link is taken off by whoever added it and by nobody else, administrators
included. The same rule as a comment and a file, for the same reason: what
somebody else put on an issue is part of the record.

## Linked issues

The other half of what a report points at is in this same tracker: the thing
that has to land first, the report somebody filed a second time, the one worth
reading beside it. Under **Linked issues**, **Link an issue** asks two things -
how they are linked, and which issue.

There are five to choose from, and they are three relations read from both
sides:

- **Relates to**, which promises nothing beyond "read that one too".
- **Blocks** and **Blocked by**, which say which of the two has to happen first.
- **Duplicates** and **Duplicated by**, which say the same thing was reported
  twice.

Parent and child are deliberately not offered. A parent is a promise about
adding things up - a status read off its children, a tree to open and close -
and this tracker has a flat list and a number, so a parent link would only be a
"relates to" wearing a word that makes people expect a roll-up that never
arrives.

A link is one fact and is stored once. Made here, it appears on the issue it
names as well, phrased from that issue's side: #7 **Blocked by** #4 on one page
is #4 **Blocks** #7 on the other, and nobody has to go and write the other half.
Taking it off from either end takes it off both.

Finding the far end is a search, and it looks for the number first - `#124`
finds #124 - with the titles behind it. What is already linked is not offered
again, and neither is the issue itself. The status of the issue at the far end
is shown beside it, because "blocked by #4" is only worth reading if it also
says whether #4 is still open; a closed one is struck through.

Two issues are linked in one way or not at all. Linking a pair that is already
linked some other way is refused rather than quietly replaced - saying that this
blocks something you had previously called a duplicate of it is a change worth
making on purpose. Linking the same pair the same way twice does nothing.

Unlike an address or a file, a link between two issues is taken off by anybody
who can see them. It is a claim about both issues rather than something one
person said, and the people at the far end never made it.

Linking is written into both issues' histories, and both issues' audiences are
told - somebody watching an issue that has just been declared blocked is exactly
somebody who wanted to know. Taking a link off is written into the histories and
not announced: it is most often a correction, and a bell that rings for
corrections is a bell people learn to ignore.

An issue with a link to another issue cannot be moved to another workspace. The
link is drawn as a number, and a number means one thing per workspace, so it
would arrive pointing at whatever holds that number where it landed. The move is
refused and names the issues in the way.

## Comments

Comments are markdown, rendered rather than printed: tables, fenced code with
the usual languages highlighted, and a single newline meaning the line break it
looks like. Raw HTML is not rendered.

Typing **@** offers the same list the assignee box does, and choosing somebody
inserts their name as text. Mentions are text rather than references on purpose:
a name still reads correctly when it is quoted somewhere else, and nothing
breaks when a display name changes. The list opens at the mention rather than at
the foot of the whole box, and the **arrow keys** move through it, with Enter or
Tab taking the name under the cursor and Escape closing it - the comment box
sits low on a long issue, and a list that has to be clicked there is a list half
of which is off the bottom of the window. Only people are notified by one - an
agent can be named in a sentence, but naming it does not summon it.

A comment is its author's to change. Editing is offered on your own and refused
on everybody else's, administrators included, and an edited comment says so. A
comment cannot be deleted; deleting the issue takes them with it.

## Files

Files can be put on the issue itself or on a single comment, and the quickest
way is to **paste a screenshot into the box you are typing in**. A picture
pasted into the description or a comment is attached where you pasted it, named
for the moment it arrived. Nothing else about pasting changes.

Pictures show a thumbnail and open over the page when clicked, with the arrow
keys stepping between the pictures on it. Anything else downloads, which is what
the server sends it as.

A file can be taken off by whoever put it there, and by nobody else - again
including administrators, for whom the way to remove somebody else's file is to
delete the issue. Removing it deletes the stored bytes as well as the row.

Attachments use the installation's own storage and its size limit, and can be
switched off for the whole installation; see Administration. Switched off, the
buttons are not offered, and what has already been attached stays readable.

## Notifications

![The bell, open beside the account menu](/screens/notifications.png)

The bell sits beside your name in the top bar, and carries a count of what is
waiting.

| It says | It happened because |
| --- | --- |
| assigned to you | somebody put an issue in your hands |
| changed state | an issue you filed, hold or watch was opened, closed or picked up |
| new comment | somebody said something on an issue you filed, hold or watch |
| mentioned you | somebody wrote your name in a comment |
| you are now an observer | somebody put you on an issue's observers |

You are never told about your own doing, and the feed crosses workspaces: it is
everything on the issues that concern you, in every workspace your roles let you
see, newest first. Each row opens the issue it is about.

Opening the panel is what marks them seen. The count is asked for on a timer of
about a minute and again whenever you come back to the window, rather than
pushed down a socket held open all day for a number that changes a few times.

## From an assistant

The tracker is offered over **MCP** as well as through this page. An assistant
can list issues, read one with its comments, open a new one, comment on it,
type it, label it and close it, and wait on a feed of what has happened since it
last looked. There is a tool for the types a workspace files, beside the one for
its labels, and it is worth calling before filing: a label can be invented on the
spot and a type is chosen from the list. It is the same workspace and the same permissions, and an issue is
addressed by the number people say, so #4 to an assistant is #4 here. See
Models and agents.

Opening one takes **observers**, by name, so an assistant can put a finding in
front of the person who should see it without assigning them the work. Naming
nobody puts the installation's administrators on instead, which is the answer to
the empty room above: a report nobody was told about is a report nobody read.

## Handing it to an agent

An issue assigned to an **agent** offers **Start by AI**. It hands that agent the
whole issue — the title, the kind, the labels, the description and the thread —
moves the issue to In progress, and says so in the thread under the agent's own
name, with a link to the task so you can watch it work. See *Tasks* under Models
and agents for what a task is and when it stops.

Pressing it twice is safe: an issue with a task already working on it refuses a
second, and the page draws what is running instead of the button. A closed issue
is not started at all. When the task ends, nothing moves the issue back — the
status is yours, and the issue's room is told what became of the task so you can
put it where you want it.

## Who can do what

Anyone who can see the workspace can read its issues, file one, comment, assign,
label, attach, link, watch and delete. There is no second set of permissions
here and no per-issue access: an issue is part of the workspace, like everything
else in it.

Some of it protects authorship rather than the workspace: a comment is edited
only by whoever wrote it, and a file or a link is removed only by whoever put it
there.

**Deleting asks first**, naming the issue by its number as well as its title,
because two issues in a workspace can read the same and the number is what
somebody came here by. It used to go on the click that reached the button, and
an issue takes its comments, its attachments and its whole history with it, none
of which anything here brings back.

Two things need the **administrator** role, and for different reasons. Moving an
issue to another workspace, because it is the one thing that changes which
workspace an issue belongs to. And putting somebody *other than yourself* on the
observers, or taking them off, because that is deciding what news reaches
another person. Watching an issue yourself needs nothing.

Filing, closing, reopening, attaching, linking, watching, moving and deleting
are written to the workspace's audit log.
